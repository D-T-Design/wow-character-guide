			<h2>About WoW TBC Classic Character Guide</h2>
			<main>
				<p>
					This website is your cheat sheet for playing World of Warcraft Classic and Burning Crusade
					Classic. Enter your character's details and get a list of gear to get, zones to go to, and
					class guides for your class.
				</p>
				<p>
					New and returning players of World of Warcraft Classic could use some help guiding them to
					make the most of time spent. Even a veteran player may hop on an old character and wonder
					which dungeon or zone to travel to. This guide has you covered!
				</p>
				<p>
					Just for a bit of extra fun, I added in Class Content Creators to the Class Guides page.
					There I feature prominent YouTubers, and Twitch streamers who I've seen play a certain
					class. If you would like to see other creators included on the site, reach me on the
					Contact page.
